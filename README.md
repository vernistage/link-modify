# Link Tracker

This project is live on Heroku: https://link-modify.herokuapp.com/

## Description of Project

* User must be able to input a short link and have that link forward to the proper destination URL. For example, if I create an entry for ‘google’ and have it forward to https://google.com then it would result in the url http://[host].com/google forwarding to https://google.com 
* User must be able to create, read, update and delete these shortlinks without needing an account.
* For every shortlink, there needs to be a button to send the shortlink via SMS to a number of the user’s choosing. That SMS says, “Hi, check out this awesome website: [shortlink url here]”
